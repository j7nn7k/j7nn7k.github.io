Finding images for websites is hard. We ([at our company particulate](http://www.particulate.me/)) try to use as many self taken pictures as possible since it's a bit more personal. As we have very good hobby photographers in our team that works quite well for us. But once in a while we need stock photos for certain sections on our site. Here's a list of stock photo sites with good images. Most of them are free.


<h2>Free community stock photos for commercial use</h2>
Unsplash came up with an interesting new model for stock photos. x new photos each x days. In the last months more sites like unsplash came into the picture.

_Update 2013-02-05_ Yeah, added another 5 sites from [Dustin Senos' arcticle](https://medium.com/design-ux/62ae4bcbe01b).
