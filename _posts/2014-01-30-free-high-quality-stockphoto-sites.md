Finding images for websites is hard. We try to use as many self taken pictures as possible since it's a bit more personal. As we have very good hobby photographers in our team that works quite well for us. But once in a while we need stock photos for certain sections on our site. Here's a list of stock photo sites with good images. Most of them are free.
