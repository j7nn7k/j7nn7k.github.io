title: New Product Experiment: Pump - The no-BS Workout App - Part 1
---

As you might know from reading past entries in my blog I like experimenting with new apps and products. Sometimes it goes [well](http://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=eu.greenrobot.kennzeichen) and sometimes it doesnâ€™t quite work out as [expected](http://memorioapp.de/). Read about my [past product experiments here](LINK).

In this series of articles I'd like to write about the process of developing and marketing my new app project [Pump - The no-Bullshit workout app](http://pump-app.com/). I will lay out my tactics and hope to get feedback from you about them. So here is where we stand an what we have planed:

About 1,5 years ago I gotten into fitness and couldn't find a nice workout app to track my progress. At least for Android and WP8. That's how I came about the idea of [Pump](http://pump-app.com/). 

Why did I start the app project?  

1. The MVP was pretty quickly to build
2. I have at least a little expertise/interest in the field
3. The market seems big enough 

With those basic assumptions my friend and college Philipp and I started building the MVP with the excellent [Xamarin](http://xamarin.com) and [MvvmCross](http://github.com/MvvmCross/MvvmCross) after work and on weekends. We released the first versions at Jan 1st 2015.

Up to now the download figures are pretty low, especially for Android. We figure that is because a new fitness app is impossible to find on the app stores. So here is the plan to change that:

* Keyword research esp. for app stores
* App Store Tuning: Keywords, Experiment with app name, Translations
* Get listed in some online directories
* Blog posts about popular online fitness programs
* Comments on blog posts and youtube with relevant fitness content
* Set google alerts for articles about popular online fitness programs
* Send emails to the creators/operators of popular online fitness programs
* Try payed ads esp. Facebook

What do you think? How would you prioritize?

I would love to hear your feedback and ideas. Leave comments here...
