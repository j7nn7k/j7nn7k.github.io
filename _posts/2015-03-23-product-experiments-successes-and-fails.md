title: Product Experiments - Successes and Fails
---

Last year was pretty exciting. I quit my job as a managing partner at my startup [particulate](http://particulate.me) and left for a new company - [BRICKMAKERS](http://brickmakers.de) where I work now as a lead developer for mobile and web apps mostly for external clients.

I also had my first mini exit when I sold my app [Kennzeichen](http://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=eu.greenrobot.kennzeichen)  aka. Numberplate.

Inspired by books and articles about lean startup and similar techniques (eg. [this](http://gettingreal.37signals.com/) & [this](http://theleanstartup.com/))  I decided to go this path for new projects. The lean startup principles made sense to me in a natural way because by then my most successful project  [Kennzeichen](http://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=eu.greenrobot.kennzeichen) aka. Numberplate was my biggest success, mostly in terms of user numbers. And I followed lean principles there without even knowing about the lean startup book.


## First Lean Project: memorio - Appointment Reminder App

So the first project I started consciously with lean startup principles was [memorio](http://memorioapp.de/). Basically a web app for doctors or therapists to remind their patients about appointments. I started out by sending surveys to doctor's email addresses I found on the web. In a nutshell I asked them about their current and future interest in appointment reminder software. The response rate was pretty good and I can recommend this tactic, but it turned out that almost all doctors in Germany, where I conducted the survey, already have invested heavily in pretty powerful clinic software. To get doctors to invest in another, unknown tool would have taken a lot of sales firepower which I don’t have. 

While the survey was still running I setup a landing page and started building a prototype with [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/), to try and see if people would use the tool, but I decided to kill the idea because I figured that the MVP to build to get better than the already existing tools would have taken too long. Also I didn't get much response over the landing page and had the feeling that Django wasn’t the right tool for the job. But that’s another story. 

**Conclusion for memorio:** I could have tried other customer segments but I just didn’t feel confident enough with the idea and felt that the marketing and sales for such a thing would be too time consuming partly because I have no expertise in the medical field whatsoever. I still like the idea, but the project became too big to do after hours and on the weekend. I also had other ideas cooking which I liked more.


## Second Lean Project: fa2png - Online font awesome to png converter

After starting a project that felt like a resource killer in terms of development and sales/marketing I wanted to do something really small. So I decided to build the small web app [fa2png.io](http://fa2png.io) together with my buddy [Stephan](http://www.minddust.com). You can read about fa2png’s story [here] (/blog/2014/05/26/weekend-project-font-awesome-to-png.html). 

In terms of users and learning it was a success. We build the first version really fast and „released“ it via [Hacker News](http://news.ycombinator.com). Since then the user numbers are slowly but steady increasing. By now Stephan is polishing and soon releasing a new version of fa2png. It will be under a different name and will have many new features like more icon fonts etc. I’m sure he will be writing about it on his [blog](http://www.minddust.io).

**Conclusion for fa2png:** The following conclusion is not exactly news, especially to Hacker News readers, but a domain where you feel at home - in my case development - is a very important factor for successful projects. Also the fact that you can build a working and useful MVP in a short time frame is crucial to a project’s success. This conclusion lead me to my current project - [Pump](http://pump-app.com/). 


## Third Lean Project: Pump - The no-BS Workout App

The motivation and inspiration for my current project came from different sources: Learnings from past projects, books, articles and projects of colleagues. 

Most notably my two of my colleges at [BMG14](http://www.bmg14.com/)  experimented with a [homework book app](http://www.hausaufgabenheftapp.de/) for pupils. They launched it pretty quickly using [Xamarin] (http://xamarin.com) to build an Android, iOS and Windows Phone 8 app to test which one performs best. Since the partner company of BMG14 - BRICKMAKERS - is a consulting business the app is also a pretty good showcase for future customers. Long story short they released early and iterated quickly. They attracted most of their users via Facbook's app advertising program and eventually landed a pretty deal with a big school book publisher. 

In the meantime I gotten into fitness and couldn't find a nice workout app to track my progress. That's how I came about the idea of [Pump](http://pump-app.com/). I dubbed it [The no-Bullshit workout app](http://pump-app.com/). Since that is what I wanted but didn't really exist. At least for Android and WP8. 

Why did I start the app project?  

1. The MVP was pretty quickly to build
2. I have at least a little expertise/interest in the field
3. The market seems big enough 

With those basic assumptions my friend and college Philipp and I started building the MVP after work and on weekends.

Now that the app is out for [Android](http://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=de.appsplus.pump) and [WP8](http://windowsphone.com/s?appId=835b666c-9169-463e-b315-c6a94c180cef) and iOS on the way we will have to start doing marketing and sales for the app. This is when I stumbled upon an article about the [7 minute workout app](https://medium.com/@stuartkhall/how-i-got-2-3m-app-downloads-without-spending-a-cent-on-marketing-f4823b6bc779). Which claims you need a story to "sell" your app. So here I am. Starting to spin up a story. 

I'm planning to write about the further development, marketing and sales process of the Pumo app here on my blog. Check out part 1:
