I recently downloaded the awesome game [Rymdkapsel](http://rymdkapsel.com/). It's available for Android and iOS.

I read some strategy guides on how to play the game most efficiently. I liked [this one](http://toucharcade.com/2013/08/01/rymdkapsel-tips-guide/) best.

While the author of the post does well in describing how to build stuff and which monlith to explore in which order he somehow fails to explain which monolith does what. He uses weired terms for the locations of the monoliths.

Here are the abilities the monliths.

Explore the monoliths in this order:

1.  Faster minions (top)
2.  Greater weapon reach (left)
3.  Increased extractor efficiency (right)
4.  Slower enemy waves (bottom)
